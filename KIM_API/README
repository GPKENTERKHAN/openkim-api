Files generated automatically as part of 'make all'

model_init_include.cpp
     This file is used in static linking of all Models.

model_init_include.h
     This file is used in static linking of all Models.

.*.make-temp
     These files are used by make to ensure that KIM knows about all models in
     the KIM_MODELS_DIR directory (one file for each model).

.models-deleted
     These files are used by make to detect when one or more models have been
     deleted from the KIM_MODELS_DIR directory.
