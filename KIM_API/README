This directory (KIM_API) contains the openkim-api service routines, as well as auxiliary 
files for compiling and testing.

The contents of the directory are as follows:
  
Include.mk                 -- make file used by all makefiles related to KIM
KIMservice.cpp             -- C++ implementations for core service routines and methods
KIMservice.h               -- C++ Header file for KIM API service classes, routines and methods
KIMserviceC.cpp            -- implementation of C-style interface for the KIM API 
KIMserviceC.h              -- header for C-style interface for KIM API service routines
KIMserviceDescription.txt  -- description of KIM service routines
KIMserviceF.F90            -- implementation of FORTRAN-style interface for KIM API
KIMserviceTest.cpp         -- test program for testing C++/C KIM API service routines
Makefile                   -- make file for compiling and building KIM_API using GNU or Intel 
                              compilers
README                     -- this file
RUN/                       -- directory for running tests for KIM API service routines
aKIMservice_test.F90       -- test program for FORTRAN style KIM API
model_val01.kim            -- kim descriptor file used by tests
model_val02.kim            -- kim descriptor file used by tests
si_units.cfg               -- SI units descriptor file
standard.kim               -- kim descriptor file with description of all standard variables

Files generated automatically as part of 'make all'

model_init_include.cpp     -- used in static linking of all Models
model_init_include.h       -- used in static linking of all Models
.*.make-temp               -- files used by make to ensure that KIM knows about all models
                              in the KIM_MODELS_DIR directory (one file for each model)
.models-deleted            -- files used by make to detect when one or more models have been
                              deleted from the KIM_MODELS_DIR directory.
