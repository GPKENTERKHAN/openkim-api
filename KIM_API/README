KIM API alpha release --- 31-May-2011

This directory (KIM_API) contains the KIM API service routines, as well as auxiliary 
files for compiling and testing.

The contents of the directory is as follows:
  
Include.mk                 -- make file used by all makefiles related to KIM
KIMservice.cpp             -- C++ implementations for core service routines and methods
KIMservice.h               -- C++ Header file for KIM API service classes, routines and methods
KIMserviceC.cpp            -- implementation of C-style interface for the KIM API 
KIMserviceC.h              -- header for C-style interface for KIM API service routines
KIMserviceDescription.txt  -- description of KIM service routines
KIMserviceF.F90            -- implementation of FORTRAN-style interface for KIM API
KIMserviceTest.cpp         -- test program for testing C++/C KIM API service routines
Makefile                   -- make file for compiling and building KIM_API using GNU or Intel 
                              compilers

model_val01.kim            -- kim descriptor file used by tests
model_val02.kim            -- kim descriptor file used by tests
modelsconfig.cpp           -- program to generate configuration files as part of 'make configall'
si_units.cfg               -- SI units descriptor file
standard.kim               -- kim descriptor file with description of all standard variables
