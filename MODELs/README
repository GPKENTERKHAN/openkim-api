This directory (MODELs) contains a directory for each Model to be compiled as part
of the openkim-api package.  This release includes the following example Models:

                                 its parameters, and supports optional computation of `forces', `energyPerAtoms', and `virial'
model_Ar_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H_F_f90/  --  A Lennard-Jones Model for Argon written in F90 using the NEIGH-PURE-H-F NBC, which publishes
                                     its parameters, and supports optional computation of `forces', `energyPerAtoms', and `virial'
model_Ar_LJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F_f90/  --  A Lennard-Jones Model for Argon written in F90 using the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC, which publishes
                                   its parameters, and supports optional computation of `forces', `energyPerAtoms', and `virial'
model_Ar_Ne_LJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F_f90/  --  A Lennard-Jones Model for Argon and Neon written in F90 using the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC, which
                                      publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of `forces', `energyPerAtoms',
                                      and `virial'
model_EAM_periodic_aluminum_ercolessi_adams_f90/  --  An EAM Model created by Ercolessi and Adams (for aluminum) written in F90
                                                      using the MI-OPBC-H NBC.  Currently, this model does not take advantage of
                                                      the openkim-api support for atom/particle types or model parameters
model_LJ_periodic_argon_f90/  --  A Lennard-Jones Model written in F90 for Argon using the MI-OPBC-H NBC and locator mode.
                                  Currently, this model does not take advantage of the openkim-api support for atom/particle
                                  types or model parameters
model_LJ_periodic_argon_iterator_f90/  --  A Lennard-Jones Model written in F90 for Argon using the MI-OPBC-H NBC and iterator
                                           mode.  Currently, this model does not take advantage of the openkim-api support for
                                           atom/particle types or model parameters
