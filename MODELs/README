This directory (MODELs) contains a directory for each Model to be compiled as part
of the openkim-api package.  This release includes the following example Models:

README  --  this file
Sample_01_lj_cutoff_f77/  --  A generic Lennard-Jones Model wirtten in FORTRAN77 using the NEIGH-PURE-H NBC
model_EAM_periodic_aluminum_ercolessi_adams_f90/  --  An EAM Model created by Ercolessi and Adams (for aluminum) written in F90
                                                      using the MI-OPBC-H NBC.  Currently, this model does not take advantage of
                                                      the openkim-api support for model parameters
