KIM API alpha release --- 31-May-2011

This directory (Sample_01_lj_cutoff_f77) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ) Model
with a cutoff radius written in FORTRAN.  It complies with the KIM API
interface standard and uses a cutoff radius and neighbor list supplied by a
Test.

The following files are in this directory:

LJ_mod.F                     -- FORTRAN 77 file that contains the implementation
                                of the LJ potential
LJ_mod_f77.F90               -- FORTRAN 90 wrapper interface with KIM API 
Makefile                     -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU 
                                or Intel compilers
README                       -- this file
Sample_01_lj_cutoff_f77.kim  -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and
                                methods that are exposed through the KIM API interface
