KIM API alpha release -- 11-Feb-2011

This directory (Sample_01_lj_cutoff) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ) Model with a cutoff radius written in FORTRAN.  It complies with the KIM API interface standard and uses a cutoff radius and neighbor list supplied by a Test.

The following files are in this directory:

LJ_mod.F90      -- FORTRAN module file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential
Makefile  	-- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

Sample_01_lj_cutoff.kim -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed through the KIM API interface
