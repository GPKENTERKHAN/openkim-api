KIM API alpha release --- 31-May-2011

This directory (Sample_01_lj_cutoff_c) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ) Model with
a cutoff radius written in C.  It complies with the KIM API interface standard
and uses a cutoff radius and neighbor list supplied by a Test.

The following files are in this directory:

LJ_sample1.c               -- C file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential
Makefile                   -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel 
                              compilers
README                     -- this file
Sample_01_lj_cutoff_c.kim  -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that 
                              are exposed through the KIM API interface
