This directory (model_Ar_LJ_NIGH_RVEC_F_c) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ) Model for
Argon with smoothed cutoff radius written in C.  It complies with the KIM API interface
standard, using the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC and iterator mode, and publishes its parameters,
and supports optional computation of `forces', `energyPerAtoms', and `virial'

The following files are in this directory:

model_Ar_LJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F_c.c   -- C file that contains the implementation of the LJ
                                  potential
Makefile                       -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or
                                  Intel compilers
README                         -- this file
model_Ar_LJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F_c.kim -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods
                                  that are exposed through the KIM API interface
