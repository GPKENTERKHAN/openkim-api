This directory (model_EAM_periodic_aluminum_ercolessi_adams_f90) contains an EAM Model
created by Ercolessi and Adams (for aluminum) written in F90 using the MI-OPBC-H NBC.
Currently, this model does not take advantage of the openkim-api support for atom/particle
types or model parameters.

The following files are in this directory:

model__EAM_periodic_aluminum_ercolessi_adams_f90.f90 -- FORTRAN module file that contains 
                                                        the implementation of the Ercolessi
                                                        and Adams EAM Model
Makefile                         -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or
                                    Intel compilers
README                           -- this file
model_EAM_periodic_aluminum_ercolessi_adams_f90.kim -- KIM descriptor file, contains all
                                                       variables and methods that are
                                                       exposed through the KIM API interface
