This directory (model_LJ_periodic_argon_f90) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ) Model for
Argon with smoothed cutoff radius written in F90.  It complies with the KIM API interface
standard, using the MI-OPBC-H and locator mode.  Currently, this model does not take
advantage of the openkim-api support for atom/particle types or model parameters

The following files are in this directory:

model_LJ_periodic_argon_f90.F90 -- FORTRAN module file that contains the implementation of              
                                   the LJ potential
Makefile                        -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or 
                                   Intel compilers
README                          -- this file
model_LJ_periodic_argon_f90.kim -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods
                                   that are exposed through the KIM API interface
