=== openkim-api-v1.0.0 =========================================================


* Bug fix to ex_model_Ar_P_fastLJ

* Bug fix to ex_model_Al_PF_ErcolessiAdams (and associated template file)

* Documention updates


=== openkim-api-v1.0.0 =========================================================


* Moved all examples to EXAMPLEs directory and added `make examples' target.

* Renamed all example Model Drivers, Models, and Tests.  Now have `ex_' prefix.

* Renamed nearly all API functions to improve readability and comprehension.

* Changed KIM_API_get_half_neigh and KIM_API_get_full_neigh to just
  KIM_API_get_neigh.

* Total re-work of unit handling for the API.

* Added KIM_API_model_info() function for Tests to use for discovering what a
  Model supports.

* Added KIM_API_getm_* and KIM_API_setm_* routines to get/set multiple arguments
  in one function call.

* Added KIM_API_sting_init() for use by Tests that generate their KIM descriptor
  file "on-the-fly".

* Added process_dEdr and process_dE2dr2 approach for calculating general
  properties.  Currently automatic support for `virial', `particleVirial', and
  `hessian' is available.

* Added "unsymmetric half neighbor lists" (numberContributingParticles).

* Added model/test buffers for use by Model and Test, respectively.

* Improvements in dynamic linking setup.

* Examples additions, improvements, and bug fixes.

* Bug fixes.


=== openkim-api-v0.2.0 =========================================================


* Updated documentation

* Added KIM_API_report_error() service function and updated all examples
  and templates to use this function.

* Added KIMstatus.h which contains definitions of KIM status codes.

* Added KIM_API_status_msg() service routine to return a string describing a given
  status code.

* Updated messages printed to kim.log file to be more informative.

* Model KIM descriptor files are now incorporated into the Model's binary library
  file.  This means that the file is no longer required at run time and that the
  Model must be recompiled after changes to the descriptor file.

* Added Model Driver Templates

* Added two Model Drivers and four Models based on the Model Drivers

* Removed example model_Ar_P_MMorse in favor of the Morse Driver and its Models

* Added support for Model Drivers

* Bug fixes


=== openkim-api-v0.1.2 =========================================================


* Fixed a number of bugs in the examples related to running on 64bit machines

* Fixed a bug in kim_api_get_nbc_method_f() related to running on 64bit
  machines


=== openkim-api-v0.1.1 =========================================================


* Fixed memory handling bug associated with the service functions
     KIM_API_get_listAtomTypes()
     KIM_API_get_listParams()
     KIM_API_get_listFreeParams()
     KIM_API_get_listFixedParams()
     KIM_API_get_NBC_method()

* Fixed bug in test_**_free_cluster.F90

* Renamed `README.git' to `README_GIT' to avoid confusion with the
  git convention that the extension `.git' refers to a bare repository


=== openkim-api-v0.1.0 =========================================================


* Added TEMPLATE files to help users create their own KIM Models.

* Added a number of example Models and Tests to help users understand how to
  implement their own openkim-api compliant codes.

* Added support for ATOM/PARTICLE types

* Added support for Models to publish their parameters

* Added support for Models to define a `reinit' function for use when their
  parameters are changed by a Test.

* Improved the Makefile system in general (although, more needs to be done)

* Added support for neighbor list and boundary conditions (NBC)

* Added support for dynamic linking

* Updated documentation

* Added documentation to the standard.kim file which now describes in detail
  the format and content of KIM descriptor files.

* Added README files to every directory.  These files provide a short
  (hopefully helpful) description of the contents of the directory)


=== openkim-api-v0.0.0 =========================================================


The initial release of the openkim-api package.  This was first made available
