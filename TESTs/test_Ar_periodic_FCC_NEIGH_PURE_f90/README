This directory (test_Ar_periodic_FCC_NEIGH_PURE_f90) contains a test that computes the
energy per atom in an infinite perfect FCC crystal of Argon using the NEIGH-PURE-H or
NEIGH-PURE-F NBC.  (The test uses one atom and enough `ghost' atoms to ensure that the
atom has all its neighbors [the ghost atoms have no neighbors in the neighbor list]) 

Makefile                                -- makefile to compile and build executables with
                                           GNU or Intel compilers
