Sample_01_compute_example_c              -- A simple test written in C that computes
                                            the energy of and forces on a configuration
                                            of atoms read from a data file
Sample_01_compute_example_f              -- A simple test written in Fortran that
                                            computes the energy of and forces on a
                                            configuration of atoms read from a data
                                            file
test_Ar_Ne_periodic_B2_NEIGH_RVEC_f90    -- A test that computes the minimum energy/cell of
                                            an infinite perfect B2 (CsCl-type) crystal
                                            of Argon and Neon as a function of lattice
                                            spacing.
test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_f90         -- A test that computes the energy of and forces
                                            on the atoms of an isolated (free) cubic FCC
                                            cluster of Argon atoms using the CLUSTER NBC
                                            and locator mode.
test_Ar_free_cluster_f90                 -- A test that computes the energy of and forces
                                            on the atoms of an isolated (free) cubic FCC 
                                            cluster of Argon atoms using the MI-OPBC-H or
                                            MI-OPBC-F or NEIGH-PURE-H or NEIGH-PURE-F or
                                            NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC and locator mode.
test_Ar_periodic_FCC_MI_OPBC_f90         -- A test that computes the minimum energy per atom
                                            in an infinite perfect FCC crystal of Argon, as a
                                            function of lattice spacing, using the MI-OPBC-H
                                            or MI-OPBC-F NBC.  (The test uses the Model's cutoff
                                            to create a configuration just big enough for use by
                                            the minimum image convention.)
test_Ar_periodic_FCC_NEIGH_PURE_f90      -- A test that computes the minimum energy per atom as 
                                            a function of lattice spacing in an infinite perfect
                                            FCC crystal of Argon using the NEIGH-PURE-H or
                                            NEIGH-PURE-F NBC. (The test uses one atom and enough
                                            `ghost' atoms to ensure that the atom has all its
                                            neighbors [the ghost atoms have no neighbors in the
                                            neighbor list]) 
test_Ar_periodic_FCC_NEIGH_RVEC_f90      -- A test that computes the minimum energy per atom as
                                            a function of lattice spacing in an infinite perfect
                                            FCC crystal of Argon using the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC.
                                            (The test uses a one atom configuration and
                                            constructs a neighbor list with multiple images of
                                            this one atom.)
test_Ar_periodic_cut_FCC_NEIGH_RVEC_f90  -- A test that computes the energy per atom as a 
                                            function of lattice spacing and the Model's cutoff
                                            in an infinite perfect FCC crystal of Argon using
                                            the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC.  (The test uses a one atom
                                            configuration and constructs a neighbor list with
                                            multiple images of this one atom.)
