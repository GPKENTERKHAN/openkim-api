KIM API alpha release -- 11-Feb-2011

This directory (Sample_01_compute_example_f) contains a Test that computes the energy of a given atomic configuration and the forces on the atoms.  It conforms with the KIM API interface standard and uses a Model, in this case a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential with a with cutoff radius, which also conforms to KIM_API interface standard.  The Test is written in FORTRAN.

There are three copies of the test that are linked against LJ models, written in different languages (c,f90,c++): lj_test_c.F90, lj_test_f.F90, lj_test_cpp.F90

The following files are also in this directory:

Makefile  -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

neighborlistmod.F90	-- FORTRAN module for calculating the neighbor list
myqsort.c		-- c-FORTRAN wrapper that is used by neighborlistmod.F90 to call the standard c style qsort routine

Sample_01_compute_example_f.kim -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed through the KIM API interface

data/   -- directory contains input configurations and optional output results
