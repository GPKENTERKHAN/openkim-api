This directory (Sample_01_compute_example_f) contains a Test that computes the
energy of a given atomic configuration and the forces on the atoms.  It
conforms with the KIM API interface standard and uses a Model, in this case a
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential with a with cutoff radius, which also conforms to
KIM_API interface standard.  The Test is written in FORTRAN.


The following files are  in this directory:

                                    with GNU or Intel compilers

                                    Sample_01_compute_example_f. When run, it 
                                    expects input: model name.
