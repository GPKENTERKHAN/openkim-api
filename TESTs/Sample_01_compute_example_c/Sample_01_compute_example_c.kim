# This is is the input file that defines KIM API variables
# all field strting with # are comments and ignored
# it contains section MODEL_INPUT or MODEL_OUPUT
#followed by lines, that defines variable in the following format
#
# Name		   Type	     Dim	Units/Scale		Shape		requirements
#
# Name -- unique name of variables 
# Type -- real,real*8,integer,integer*8, pointer -- tells underlying structure of an element
# Unit  -- physical unit dimension of variable -- none, length,time, mass, ...
# SistemUnits/Scale -- name of the system units (metal, KIMstandard,...) or numerical scale factor to the standard units
# Shape -- enclossed in square brackets size of each tensor dimensions for example
#          [4,3] -- will describe second rank tensor, number of elemnets 12, fastest changing index has size 3
#          [N,3,3,3] -- rank 4 index with unspecified size = N*3*3*3 and aslo slowest index has size N.
#          [NumberAtoms,3] -- rank 2 tensor,  size of the first index is defined by variable NumberAtoms
#          []  -- means scalar (or rank zero tensor)
# requirements -- it is empty field if variable is needed allaws or field set to
#		  optional -- meaning that you can switch off calculation of the variable
