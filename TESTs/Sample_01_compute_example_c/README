KIM API alpha release --- 31-May-2011

This directory (Sample_01_compute_example_c) contains a Test that computes the energy of a given atomic configuration and the forces on the atoms.  It conforms with the KIM API interface standard and uses a Model, in this case a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential with a with cutoff radius, which also conforms to KIM_API interface standard.  The Test is written in C.

The following files are also in this directory:
lj_test.c  -- main test program. Executable will be Sample_01_compute_example_c. When run, it expects input: model name.
	      example:   echo  "Sample_01_lj_cutoff_c" | ./Sample_01_compute_example_c


Makefile  -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

neighborlistmod.F90	-- FORTRAN module for calculating the neighbor list
myqsort.c		-- c-FORTRAN wrapper that is used by neighborlistmod.F90 to call the standard c style qsort routine

Sample_01_compute_example_c.kim -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed through the KIM API interface

data/   -- directory contains input configurations and optional output results
