KIM API alpha release --- 31-May-2011

This directory (Sample_01_compute_example_c) contains a Test that computes the
energy of a given atomic configuration and the forces on the atoms.  It
conforms with the KIM API interface standard and uses a Model, in this case a
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential with a with cutoff radius, which also conforms to
KIM_API interface standard.  The Test is written in C.

The following files are also in this directory:
Makefile                         -- makefile to compile and build executables with 
                                    GNU or Intel compilers
README                           -- this file
Sample_01_compute_example_c.kim  -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables
                                    and methods that are exposed through the KIM API
                                    interface
data/                            -- directory contains input configurations and 
                                    optional output results
lj_test.c                        -- main test program. Executable will be
                                    Sample_01_compute_example_c. When run, it expects 
                                    input: model name.
                                    example: > echo  "Sample_01_lj_cutoff_c" | ./Sample_01_compute_example_c
myqsort.c                        -- c-FORTRAN wrapper that is used by neighborlistmod.F90 to 
                                    call the standard c style qsort routine
neighborlistmod.F90              -- FORTRAN module for calculating the neighbor list
sample_neighbor.c                -- ???
