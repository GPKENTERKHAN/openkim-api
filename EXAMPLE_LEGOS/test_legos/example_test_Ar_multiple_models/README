This directory (test_Ar_multiple_models) contains a test that computes the
energy of a perfect Ar FCC crystal and a finite cluster as a function of
lattice spacing for two models. The test uses the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC and locator
or iterator mode.

Makefile
    Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers.

README
    This file.

test_Ar_multiple_models.c
    Code for the test.

test_Ar_multiple_models.kim
    KIM descriptor file for the test.
