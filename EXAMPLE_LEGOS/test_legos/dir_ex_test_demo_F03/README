This directory (ex_test_demo_03) contains a Test that computes the energy of a
given atomic configuration and the forces on the atoms.  It conforms with the
KIM API interface standard and uses a Model, in this case a Lennard-Jones (LJ)
potential with a with cutoff radius, which also conforms to KIM_API interface
standard.  The Test is written in FORTRAN.


The following files are  in this directory:

Makefile
     Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers.

README
     This file.

ex_test_demo_F03.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface.

data/
     Directory contains input configurations and optional output results.

ex_test_demo_F03.F03
     Main test program.  Written in Fortran 2003 standard.

myqsort.c
     c-FORTRAN wrapper that is used by neighborlistmod.F90 to call the
     standard c style qsort routine.

neighborlistmod.F90
     FORTRAN module for efficiently calculating the neighbor list.
