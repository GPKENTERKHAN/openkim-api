This directory (TEST_NAME_STR) contains a Test that compares the forces
computed by a KIM-compliant Model with those obtained using numerical
differentiation of the Model energies.

Note that this Test generates its KIM descriptor file internally and
passes this to the KIM API using service routines.

The following files are in the directory:

Makefile
     Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers.

README
     This file.

TEST_NAME_STR.F90
     F90 program that implements the test.
