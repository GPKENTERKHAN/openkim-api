This directory (TEST_NAME_STR) contains a test that computes
the minimum energy per atom in an infinite perfect FCC crystal of SPECIES_NAME_STR atoms
for a range of values for the Model's cutoff parameter.
(The test uses the most efficient calculation method possible for the NBC
method it uses.)


The following files are in the directory:

Makefile
     Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers.

README
     This file.

TEST_NAME_STR.F90
     F90 program that implements the test.

TEST_NAME_STR.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface.
