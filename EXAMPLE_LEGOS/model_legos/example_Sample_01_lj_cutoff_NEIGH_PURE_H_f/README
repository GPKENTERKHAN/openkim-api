This directory (Sample_01_lj_cutoff_NEIGH_PURE_F_f) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ) Model with a
cutoff radius written in FORTRAN.  It complies with the KIM API interface
standard and uses a cutoff radius and neighbor list supplied by a Test.

The following files are in this directory:

LJ_mod.F90               -- FORTRAN module file that contains the implementation of 
                            the LJ potential
Makefile                 -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or 
                            Intel compilers
README                   -- this file
Sample_01_lj_cutoff_NEIGH_PURE_F_f.kim  -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods
                            that are exposed through the KIM API interface
