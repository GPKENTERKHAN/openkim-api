This directory (model_Ar_Morse_c) contains a Morse pair potential Model for
Argon with smoothed cutoff radius written in C.  It complies with the KIM API interface
standard, using any NBC and iterator or locator mode, publishes its parameters,
and supports optional computation of `forces', `energyPerAtoms', and `virial'

The following files are in this directory:

model_Ar_Morse_c.c   -- C file that contains the implementation of the Morse
                        potential
Makefile             -- makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or
                        Intel compilers
README               -- this file
model_Ar_Morse_c.kim -- KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods
                        that are exposed through the KIM API interface
