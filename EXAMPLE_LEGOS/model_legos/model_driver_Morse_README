This directory (MODEL_DRIVER_NAME_STR) contains a shifted Morse pair potential
Model driver written in C.

   phi(r) = epsilon * ( - exp[ -2*C*(r - Rzero) ] + 2*exp[ -C*(r - Rzero) ] ) 
            + shift

where shift is computed so that phi(rcut) = 0.0

It complies with the KIM API interface standard, using any NBC and iterator or
locator mode, publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of
`energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', `process_dEdr', and `process_dE2dr2'.
Its initializaton routine takes a KIM API object pointer and a pointer to a
string that contains the cutoff and Morse parameters which define a KIM Model
based on this KIM Model Driver.

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, a parameter file is required.
This file must have the follwing format:
   Line 1: `cutoff' value in angstroms
   Line 2: Morse `epsilon' value in eV
   Line 3: Morse `C' value in 1/Angstroms
   Line 4: Morse `Rzero' value in Angstroms
Any additional lines will be silently ignored.


The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
    makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
    This file

MODEL_DRIVER_NAME_STR.c
    C file that contains the implementation of the Morse potential Model Driver

MODEL_DRIVER_NAME_STR.kim
    Template KIM descriptor file containing all variables and methods that are
    exposed by the driver through the KIM API interface.  This file will be
    used (by the make system) to generate a KIM descriptor file for each KIM
    Model based on this Model Driver.
