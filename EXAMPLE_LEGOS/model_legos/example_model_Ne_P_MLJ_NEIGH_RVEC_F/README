This directory (model_Ne_P_MLJ_NIGH_RVEC_F) contains a modified Lennard Jones
(LJ) Model for Neon with smoothed cutoff radius written in C.  It complies with
the KIM API interface standard, using the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC and iterator mode,
and publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of `forces',
`energyPerAtoms', and `virial'

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
    Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
    This file

model_Ne_P_MLJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F.c
    C file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential

model_Ne_P_MLJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F.kim
    KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
    through the KIM API interface
