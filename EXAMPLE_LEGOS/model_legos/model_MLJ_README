This directory (MODEL_NAME_STR) contains a modified Lennard Jones (LJ) Model
with smoothed cutoff radius written in LANGUAGE_STR.  It complies with the KIM
API interface standard, using the NBC_NAME_STR NBC and locator mode, and
publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of `energy',
`forces', `particleEnergy', and `virial'.


The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
     makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
     this file

MODEL_NAME_STR.LANGUAGE_STR
     LANGUAGE_STR file that contains the implementation of the modified LJ potential

MODEL_NAME_STR.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface
