This directory (MODEL_NAME_STR) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ) Model for Argon
with smoothed cutoff radius written in F90.  It complies with the KIM API
interface standard, using the NBC_NAME_STR NBC and locator mode, and 
publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of `forces',
`energyPerAtoms', and `virial'.
