This directory (model_ArNe_P_MLJ_NIGH_RVEC_F) contains a modified Lennard Jones
(LJ) Model for Argon and Neon with smoothed cutoff radius written in F90.  It
complies with the KIM API interface standard, using the NEIGH-RVEC-F NBC and
locator mode, and publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation
of `forces', `energyPerAtoms', and `virial'

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
     makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README

model_ArNe_P_MLJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F.F90
     Fortran module file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential

model_ArNe_P_MLJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface
