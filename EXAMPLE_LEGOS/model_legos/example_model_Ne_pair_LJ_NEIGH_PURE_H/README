NOTE: THIS DIRECTORY IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY THE openkim-api MAKESYSTEM

This directory (model_Ne_pair_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ)
Model for neon with a discontinuous cutoff radius written in FORTRAN.  It
complies with the KIM API interface standard, using the NEIGH-PURE-H NBC and
iterator mode, and supports optional computation of `forces' and
`energyPerAtoms'.

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
    Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
    This file

model_Ne_pair_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H.F90
    F90 wrapper interface with KIM API

model_Ne_pair_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H.kim
    KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
    through the KIM API interface

model_Ne_pair_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H_compute.F
    FORTRAN 77 file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential
