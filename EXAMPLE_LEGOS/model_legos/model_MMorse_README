This directory (MODEL_NAME_STR) contains a modified Morse pair potential Model
with smoothed cutoff radius written in C.  It complies with the KIM API
interface standard, using any NBC and iterator or locator mode, publishes its
parameters, and supports optional computation of `forces', `energyPerAtoms',
and `virial'.

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
    makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
    This file

MODEL_NAME_STR.c
    C file that contains the implementation of the Morse potential

MODEL_NAME_STR.kim
    KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
    through the KIM API interface
