This directory (model_Ne_P_fastLJ) contains a shifted Lennard-Jones (LJ) pair
potential Model for Neon written in C.  It complies with the KIM API interface
standard, using any NBC, iterator mode, publishes its parameters, and supports
optional computation of `energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', and
`process_dEdr'.  The Model is optimized for speed and specifically for the case
where `energy' and `forces' are the only quantites to be computed.

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
     Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
     This file

model_Ne_P_fastLJ.c
     C file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential

model_Ne_P_fastLJ.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface
