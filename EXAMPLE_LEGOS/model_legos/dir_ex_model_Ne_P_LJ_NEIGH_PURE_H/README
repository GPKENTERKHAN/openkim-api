This directory (ex_model_Ne_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ)
Model for neon with a discontinuous cutoff radius written in FORTRAN.  It
complies with the KIM API interface standard, using the NEIGH_PURE_H NBC and
iterator mode, and supports optional computation of `forces' and
`particleEnergys'.

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
     Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
     This file

ex_model_Ne_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H.F90
     F90 wrapper interface with KIM API

ex_model_Ne_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface

ex_model_Ne_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H_compute.F
     FORTRAN 77 file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential
