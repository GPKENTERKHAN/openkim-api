This directory (model_demo_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H_F77) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ)
Model with a cutoff radius written in FORTRAN.  It complies with the KIM API
interface standard and uses a cutoff radius and neighbor list supplied by a
Test.

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
     Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers.

README

model_demo_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H_F77.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface.

model_demo_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H_F77_compute.F
