=========================== The openkim-api package ===========================

This file provides a guide to the material provided with the openKIM API
package. It suggests an order for reading the various documentation and
code files to facilitate the learning process.


STEP 0

   It you have not already done so, read the README file in the API root 
   directory (by defaulti: openkim-api-XX.XX.XX/README) and follow the 
   instructions in the INSTALL file in the same directory to install the openKIM 
   API package.


STEP 1

   Read openKIM_introduction_XX.XX.XX.pdf which is located in the DOCs directory 
   (same directory as this file). This file contains a presentation providing an
   overview of the openKIM project and basic concepts related to the openKIM API.


STEP 2

   The openKIM API package comes with a number of example Models (interatomic
   potentials) and Tests (simulation codes) which demonstrate how the API works. 
   Read about the provided Models and Tests in these two files:

   MODELs/EXAMPLES.README
   TESTs/EXAMPLES.README

   The files include a list the Models/Tests and brief descriptions of
   what they do.


STEP 3

   Included with the package is a script that runs all of the possible
   combinations of Models and Tests (see TESTs/EXAMPLES.README for the
   list of Model/Test compatibilities). Run this script:

   % cd $KIM_DIR/TESTs
   % ./run_all_tests > run_all_tests.out

   The above command redirects the output to the file `run_all_tests.out'.
   Look over this file to see what the output generated by the different
   Tests looks like. You can also look at the script file itself 
   (`run_all_tests') to see how a Test/Model combintation is run and 
   run Tests yourself from the command line. For example, from the 
   TESTs directory, you can type:

   % echo "model_Ar_P_MLJ_C" | test_Ar_free_cluster/test_Ar_free_cluster

   which will run `test_Ar_free_cluster' with the `model_Ar_P_MLJ_C'
   potential. In this case, this is a Test written in Fortran 90 running
   a modified Lennard-Jones potential for Ar written in C.


STEP 4

   Now that we have seen some examples of the openKIM API in operation, the
   next step is to understand how it works. This is the stage where we need
   to start looking at computer code.

   The list of Models and Tests is given in MODELs/EXAMPLES.README and
   TESTs/EXAMPLES.README. Each of those files includes a brief description
   of the Models/Tests in order of increasing complexity and noting the
   programming language.  For example, the simplest Test is

   test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_C

   which is written in C. (The same program written in Fortran 90 which is
   called `test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_F90' is also provided.) This test
   computes the energy and forces on the atoms of an isolated cluster of Ar 
   atoms arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure.  The Tests do not 
   provide neighbor list handling.  The called Model must loop over all atoms 
   to find the neighbors of a given atom.

   The computer code for this Model and corresponding KIM descriptor file
   are located in

   TESTs/test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_C/test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_C.c
   TESTs/test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_C/test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_C.kim

   Read these two files (or the corresponding files for the Fortran Test).
   As you read, you can refer to the following files:

   DOCs/KIMserviceDescription.txt
   DOCs/standard.kim

   The first file, `KIMserviceDescription.txt', is a reference file which 
   explains the functioning of the different KIM service routines which are 
   called by the Test code. The second file, `standard.kim' explains the 
   lines that appear in the KIM descriptor file.




This is a modified Lennard-Jones potential
   for Ar (here "modified" reflects the fact that a quadratic function is added 
   to the Lennard-Jones potential to obtain a smooth cutoff). The Model only
   works with the `CLUSTER' neighbor list and boundary condition (NBC) method
   which does not use neighbor list information.

   The computer code for this model is located in

   $KIM_DIR/MODELs/model_Ar_P_MLJ_CLUSTER/model_Ar_P_MLJ_CLUSTER.F90

   Read through this code 


For example, the simplest Model is

   model_Ar_P_MLJ_CLUSTER

   which is written in Fortran 90. This is a modified Lennard-Jones potential
   for Ar (here "modified" reflects the fact that a quadratic function is added 
   to the Lennard-Jones potential to obtain a smooth cutoff). The Model only
   works with the `CLUSTER' neighbor list and boundary condition (NBC) method
   which does not use neighbor list information.

   The computer code for this model is located in

   $KIM_DIR/MODELs/model_Ar_P_MLJ_CLUSTER/model_Ar_P_MLJ_CLUSTER.F90
