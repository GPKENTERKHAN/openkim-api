KIM API alpha release --- 11-Feb-2011

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions for installing, compiling and linking the KIM API alpha release:

1. In the desired directory, execute the command:  

tar xvfz KIMdevelAlphaFeb11.tgz 

2. Change directory to KIMdevel/KIM_API and, in the file Include.mk, 
edit the line: 

KIM_DIR =$(HOME)/KIMdevel/ 

so that it points to the correct path where the KIM files are located. 

If you want to compile with fortran subroutines (this is not advisable
if your gfortran compiles is less than version 4.4.X) then comment 
the following line (in file KIMdevel/KIM_API):

NO_FORTRAN=1

3. By default, all make files use the GNU compilers for 64 bit linux. 

In order to use the Intel compiler, define the environment variable 
INTEL (bash: export INTEL="yes"). 

For using a 32 bit machine, define the environment variable SYSTEM32 
(bash: exportSYSTEM32="yes"). 

4. Change to the KIMdevel directory and execute the commands: 

make clean 
make 

This will compile the KIM API and example Tests and Models. In this release,
we include a Test to compute the total energy and forces on the atoms in a 
sample atomic configuration. Two versions of the Test are included in C
and Fortran 90. These Test link with a Lennard-Jones (LJ) Model written in three
languages: C, C++ and Fortan 90. There are therefore 2 x 3 = 6 executables 
generated by the make command which are stored in directories:

Sample_01_compute_example_c
Sample_01_compute_example_f

under TESTs.

5. To run a Test, change to the appropriate directory and run the executable.
For example,

cd TESTs/Sample_01_compute_example_f
./Sample_01_compute_example_f_c

This will run the Fortran Test coupled to the C LJ Model. The Test echoes the
data stored in the KIM API object, the forces on the atoms, and the total 
energy.  Similarly, Sample_01_compute_example_f_cpp runs the same Test coupled
to the C++ LJ Model, and Sample_01_compute_example_f_f couples to the Fortran
LJ Model. A similar set of files exists for the C Test in the directory
Sample_01_compute_example_c.

6. Each Test (and Model) has its own make file for compiling and linking. 
If changes are made to the code, perform the second command of step (4) again.


TROUBLESHOOTING: By default, the make system uses the g++ compiler with 
the -lgfortran option to link compiled FORTRAN executables. If (for some
versions of linux or GNU compilers) linking of FORTRAN executables with the
g++ compiler does not work, try gfortran with the -lstdc++ option.  See lines
52-55 in the Include.mk file. 

GNU compilers must be version 4.4.1 or higher, the Intel compiler must be
version 11.1 or higher.
