KIM API alpha release --- 31-May-2011

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions for installing, compiling and linking the KIM API alpha release:

1. In the desired directory, execute the command:  

tar xvfz KIMdevelxxxxxxx.tgz 

2. Set up environment variable:
bash:
export KIM_DIR = /your_loacation/KIMdevel/ 

you_location is the correct path where KIMdevel dirrectory is located.


3. By default, all make files use the GNU compilers for 64 bit linux. 

In order to use the Intel compiler, define the environment variable 
KIM_INTEL
bash: 
export KIM_INTEL="yes". 

For using a 32 bit machine, define the environment variable KIM_SYSTEM32 
bash: 
export KIM_SYSTEM32="yes" 

4. Change to the KIMdevel directory and execute the commands: 


make configall 

will prepare list of all models and tests and create all correspondend
include files (make cleanall -- will clean all temp. include files)

make

will build all models tests and compile KIM_API (make clean -- will
remove all .o, .a, .so and executables) 



5. To run a Test, change to the appropriate directory and run the executable.
For example,

cd TESTs/Sample_01_compute_example_f

echo " Sample_01_lj_cutoff_f" | ./Sample_01_compute_example_f

Each test sample (example Sample_01_compute_example_f and 
Sample_01_compute_example_c) read from console name of the model, initiate it 
and computes the total energy and forces using given coordinates configuration 



6. Each Test (and Model) has its own make file for compiling and linking. 
If changes are made to the code, perform the second command of step (4) again.


7. In case of using non-standard location of directores KIM_API, TESTs and MODELs
the following additional environment variable must be set:
KIM_API_DIR, KIM_TEST_DIR,KIM_MODELS_DIR




TROUBLESHOOTING: By default, the make system uses the g++ compiler with 
the -lgfortran option to link compiled FORTRAN executables. If (for some
versions of linux or GNU compilers) linking of FORTRAN executables with the
g++ compiler does not work, try gfortran with the -lstdc++ option.  See lines
78-79 in the Include.mk file (change it to 76-77). 

GNU compilers tested with version  4.2.x or higher, the Intel compiler must be
version 11.1 or higher.
