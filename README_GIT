=========================== The openkim-api package ===========================

This file provides supplemental information for users who want to work with the
openkim-api package through github.com and the git revision control program.

There are only a couple of significant differences between the source tarball
files that are distributed as openkim-api-vX.X.X.tgz and the openkim-api git
repository.

1. The primary difference is that in the git repository there are no example
   Models, Model Drivers, or Tests in the EXAMPLEs directory.  Instead the user
   must generate the examples by the following process:

   % cd $KD/EXAMPLE_LEGOS
   % make

   This will cobble together the example files for the various fragments stored
   in the $KD/EXAMPLE_LEGOS/model_legos and $KD/EXAMPLE_LEGOS/test_legos
   directories and save them in the $KD/EXAMPLEs/MODELs/,
   $KD/EXAMPLEs/MODEL_DRIVERs/, and $KD/EXAMPLEs/TESTs/ directories,
   respectively.  This need only be done once (for every time the git
   repository is updated from github.com).  This process will overwrite any
   changes to files made in the $KD/EXAMPLEs directory, so make a backup of
   these directories if you don't want to lose your changes.

2. The git repository has the files:

      $KD/DOCs/openkim-api-introduction.pdf
      $KD/DOCs/openkim-api-introduction.pptx

   whereas the openkim-api-vX.X.X.tgz package has the file

      $KD/DOCs/openkim-api-vX.X.X-introduction.pdf

3. The openkim-api-vX.X.X.tgz package has the file

      $KD/openkim-api.version.info

   which contains the SHA1 Hash value of the git commit object from which the
   package was created, along with the date, time, and user name and email
   address of the person who created the package.
