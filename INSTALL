=========================== The openkim-api package ===========================

This file contains instructions for installing the openKIM API package.
If you are new to KIM and the openKIM API (application programming interface)
start by reading the README file in this directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

To install the openKIM API package you need the following:

1. Unix/Linux/Mac OSX system

2. GNU make

3. GNU compilers (gcc, g++, gfortran) version 4.2.x or higher or the 
   corresponding Intel compilers, version 11.1 or higher.

(See comments below under TROUBLESHOOTING regarding compiler issues.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS for installing, compiling and linking this openkim-api release:

1. Set up necessary environment variables.

   (a) Define the location of the openKIM API root directory.  For example, 
       if you untarred the `openkim-api-XX.XX.XX.tgz' tarball in your home 
       directory, you would do:

       bash:
       % export KIM_DIR=~/openkim-api-XX.XX.XX/

       Make sure to include the trailing slash. The `%' symbol represents the
       operating system prompt and should not be typed.

       (Above `XX.XX.XX' represents the current release number.) 

   (b) By default, all makefiles use the GNU compilers for 64 bit Linux.  
       In order to use the Intel compiler, define the environment variable
       KIM_INTEL

       bash: 
       % export KIM_INTEL="yes". 

   (c) For using a 32 bit machine, define the environment variable KIM_SYSTEM32 

       bash: 
       % export KIM_SYSTEM32="yes" 

    It is recommended to place the above environment variables definitions in 
    your shell setup file which is located in your home directory 
    (e.g. ~/.bashrc).


2. To compile the package, change to the $KIM_DIR directory and execute make:

   % cd $KIM_DIR
   % make

     This builds all Models, Tests, and the openKIM API service routine library

       `make'             -- compiles the API and all Models and Tests
       `make all'         -- same as `make'
       `make openkim-api' -- compiles only the API
       `make clean'       -- will remove all .o, .mod, .a, .so and executable
                             files

3. Verify that the compilation was successful by running a Test.

   The provided example Tests read in the name of a Model (or Models) which
   they use to perform their calculations. For most Tests the name of the Model
   can be piped in using an `echo' command.  For example, the following Fortran
   Test reads in one Model:

   % cd TESTs/test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_F90
   % echo "model_Ar_P_MLJ_CLUSTER_C" | ./test_Ar_free_cluster_CLUSTER_F90

   The exception to this rule is the example Test `test_Ar_multiple_models',
   which reads in two Model names from the command line.  For example:

   % cd TESTs/test_Ar_multiple_models
   % ./test_Ar_multiple_models model_Ar_P_MLJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F model_Ar_P_MMorse

  (See the README files in the Test directories for an explanation of what 
   the Tests do.)


4. Each Test (and Model) has its own make file for compiling and linking.  If
   changes are made to the code, perform step (2) again (from the root
   directory).


5. In case of using a non-standard location for any of the directories KIM_API,
   TESTs, or MODELs one or more of the following environment variables must be
   set:

     KIM_API_DIR
     KIM_TESTS_DIR
     KIM_MODELS_DIR


6. The openkim-api package provides the possibility of creating dynamic load
   libraries by setting the KIM_DYNAMIC environment variable.

   bash:
   % export KIM_DYNAMIC=yes

   If KIM_DYNAMIC is not set, the models will be built and linked statically.

   If KIM_DYNAMIC is set, the makefile will build .so libraries (in addition to
   the static .a libraries) and KIM API will use those libraries to load models
   and call initialize routines dynamically (during runtime). The use of dynamic
   linking may prevent problems of name clashes when multiple Models are read in
   by a Test. This is still being investigated.

   Note: Currently static linking is the default option because older versions of
         the gnu compiler do not provide dynamic loading by default.  In 
         addition, some versions of MPI only work with static linking.  In 
         future releases, it is expected that dynamic linking will become the 
         default method.
       

7. The openkim-api package provides wrapper routines for accessing the neighbor
   list object. These routines check to ensure that the maximum number of
   neighbors for an atom does not exceed KIM_API_MAX_NEIGHBORS. If this
   environment variable is not set, the default value is 512.  To change the
   value of this parameter, for example, to 1024 (or any other value) use the
   command:

   bash:
   % export KIM_API_MAX_NEIGHBORS=1024

Once the installation is successfully completed, read the README file in
the DOCs directory for a step-by-step guide to learning the openKIM API.

TROUBLESHOOTING

1. Non-Standard Compilers: If you need to make changes to compiler flags either
   because you are using a non-standard compiler or an older version of the gnu
   compiler, change lines 53-72 in KIM_API/Include.mk

2. Linking problems: By default, the make system uses the g++ compiler with the
   -lgfortran option to link compiled FORTRAN executables. If (for some versions
   of Linux or GNU compilers) linking of FORTRAN executables with the g++ 
   compiler does not work, try gfortran with the -lstdc++ option.  See lines 
   66-67 in the Include.mk file (change them to lines 68-69).
